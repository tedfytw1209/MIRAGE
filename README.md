MIRAGE is a multimodal foundation model for comprehensive retinal OCT/SLO image analysis. It is trained on a large-scale dataset of multimodal data, and is designed to perform a wide range of tasks, including disease staging, diagnosis, and layer and lesion segmentation. MIRAGE is based on the [MultiMAE](https://github.com/EPFL-VILAB/MultiMAE) architecture, and is pretrained using a multi-task learning strategy. The model, based on [ViT](https://github.com/google-research/vision_transformer), is available in two sizes: MIRAGE-Base and MIRAGE-Large.



> [!IMPORTANT]
> All scripts and code are intended to run on [Linux](https://github.com/torvalds/linux) systems.


## Overview

![Overview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17548d43-46c0-476c-b006-dbe6b286e82c)


**Overview of the proposed model (MIRAGE) and other general (DINOv2) and domain-specific (MedSAM, RETFound) foundation models.**
In contrast to existing unimodal foundation models, our approach utilizes multimodal self-supervised learning to train a Vision Transformer on a large dataset of paired multimodal retinal images, including optical coherence tomography (OCT), scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO), and automatically generated labels for retinal layers.
We evaluated the model on a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 19 tasks from 14 publicly available datasets and two private datasets, covering both OCT and SLO classification and segmentation tasks. Statistical significance was calculated using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test across all datasets.
Our foundation model, MIRAGE, significantly outperforms state-of-the-art foundation models across all task types.



## Quick start

For a quick start, use the provided script [prepare_env.py](prepare_env.py) to create a new python environment, install the required packages, and download the model weights and the datasets.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The script will download the model weights and the datasets, which are large files. Make sure you have enough disk space and a stable internet connection.
>
> In addition, if the system Python version is not 3.10.*, it will install Python 3.10.16 (from source) in the same directory. It will also install PyTorch 2.5.1 (CUDA 11.8).


```bash
./prepare_env.py
```

> [!TIP]
> Run the script with the `-h` or `--help` flag to see the available options.


### Basic usage with Hugging Face 🤗

The models can be easily used with the `hf/mirage_hf.py` code and loading the weights with Hugging Face 🤗. The only requirement is having the `torch`, `einops`, `huggingface_hub`, and `safetensors` packages installed.

```python
from huggingface_hub import PyTorchModelHubMixin
from mirage_hf import MIRAGEWrapper


class MIRAGEhf(MIRAGEWrapper, PyTorchModelHubMixin):
    def __init__(
        self,
        input_size=512,
        patch_size=32,
        modalities='bscan-slo',
        size='base',
    ):
        super().__init__(
            input_size=input_size,
            patch_size=patch_size,
            modalities=modalities,
            size=size,
        )

# For the MIRAGE model based on ViT-Base
model = MIRAGEhf.from_pretrained("j-morano/MIRAGE-Base")
# For the MIRAGE model based on ViT-Large
model = MIRAGEhf.from_pretrained("j-morano/MIRAGE-Large")
```


## Requirements

> [!NOTE]
> The code has been tested with PyTorch 2.5.1 (CUDA 11.8) and Python 3.10.10.


### pip

Create a new python environment and activate it:
```bash
python -m venv venv  # if not already created
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Model weights

The model weights are available in the [Model weights release](https://github.com/j-morano/MIRAGE/releases/tag/weights) on GitHub.

| Model | Link |
| --- | --- |
| MIRAGE-Base | [Weights-Base](https://github.com/j-morano/MIRAGE/releases/download/weights/MIRAGE-Base.pth) |
| MIRAGE-Large | [Weights-Large](https://github.com/j-morano/MIRAGE/releases/download/weights/MIRAGE-Large.pth) |


## Inference

The script `mirage_wrapper.py` provides a simple pipeline to load the model and run inference on a single sample.
This sample is already included in the repository (`_example_images/`) and consists of a triplet of OCT, SLO, and layer segmentation images.

To run the inference, simply execute the script:
```bash
python mirage_wrapper.py
```

Check the code for more details.



## Evaluation benchmark

We provide all the publicly available datasets used in the benchmark with the data splits.
See [docs/segmentation_benchmark.md](docs/segmentation_benchmark.md) for more details on the segmentation benchmark, and [docs/classification_benchmark.md](docs/classification_benchmark.md) for the classification benchmark.


## Pretraining

Although we do not provide the pretraining data due to privacy concerns, we provide the code to pretrain MIRAGE on a multimodal dataset.
Please check the [docs/pretraining.md](docs/pretraining.md) for more details.


## Tuning

We provide the code to fine-tune MIRAGE and other state-of-the-art foundation models for OCT segmentation tasks.
Please check the [docs/segmentation_tuning.md](docs/segmentation_tuning.md) for more details.

We also provide the code to fine-tune the models for OCT and SLO classification tasks.
More information can be found in the [docs/classification_tuning.md](docs/classification_tuning.md) file.
